## Welcome to the course!

**It is great to have you here!**

We will use this interactive document to start our journey of learning
R. This format will make it easier for you to get to know the most basic
concepts behind R.

Later in the course, we will switch to the official *Integrated
Development Environment* (IDE) **RStudio**.

But for now, just follow this document and get ready to type some code.

And because this is a course on a programming language, it is needless
to say that we will casually add GIFs to support you on your journey!

## What is R

### What is R?

R is a widely used statistical programming language popular with users
in academia and industry. It was developed in the early 1990s by Ross
Ihaka and Robert Gentleman and released in 2000. R is constantly being
further developed by "The R Foundation". In addition to its inherent functionality, it also allows the use of external packages (see below) - quasi complete computational commands or data.

Companies such as Facebook, Google, Twitter or Airbnb also use R, e.g.
for advertising effectiveness, economic forecasts, statistical analyses
or data visualization.

***

### Why should I use R?

**R comes with many advantages...**

-   R has a simple syntax similar to English.
-   R is developed under an open source license, which allows it to be
    installed for free and even used for commercial purposes.
-   R works on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux).
-   R has a large community. Many developers provide packages for the
    general public.

## Teaser

In this short teaser, we will give a preview of what a typical R-workflow looks like. By the end of this course, you will be fully equipped to do the same operations by your own. 
To execute the code, either...

-   Put your cursor on the line that contains R code and press "Run" on
    the top right side of this panel
-   Put your cursor on the line that contains R code and press ctrl +
    enter (german keyboard: strg + enter)

***
For this tutorial, we will use the [**Starwars character**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/starwars.html) dataset. This dataset contains a range of information on Starwars Characters, such as their names, sex and gender, body features, or from which planet they are from.
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/YRbqmR6ucyRr7Hd0fp/giphy.gif)


In this turorial, we try to answer the following research question

> **Is there a significant relationship between the `height` and the `mass` of Starwars characters?"**

***
### Getting Started

We will start with inspecting the data. The dataset `df` is already loaded, so we can use it right away! Just execute the line of code (either via the green `Run Code`-Button or using strg/cmd + enter)

```{r demo1, exercise=TRUE}
df
```

To get a summary of the dataset, we can use the `glimpse()` function

```{r demo2, exercise=TRUE}
glimpse(df)
```

The function `dim()` gives us the dimensions of the dataset.

```{r demo3, exercise=TRUE}
dim(df)
```

As we can see, our dataset has a total of 87 rows, and 14 columns!

***
Lets calculate the correlation between characters height and their mass

First, we can inspect the distribution of height and mass in more detail

```{r demo55, exercise=TRUE}
print("Summary statistics for the variable height")
summary(df$height)
print("Summary statistics for the variable mass")
summary(df$mass)
```

And calculate Pearsons r

```{r demo4, exercise=TRUE}
pearson_r <- cor.test(df$height, # defines variable 1
                      df$mass, # defines variable 2
                                   method="pearson", # defines which correlation type to calculate
                                   use="complete.obs") # specifies that missing data should not be considered

print(pearson_r)
```

The correlation coefficient is low (r = .13) and the p-value is not significant (p = 0.312)!
So should we conclude that the relationship between `mass` and `height` is not significant in the Starwars universe? **No!**.

Maybe we can learn more from plotting the data

```{r demo5, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = height, y = mass))+ #Ggplot
  geom_point()
```

Around the height of ~170cm, there is one outlier with a mass of >1000 kg.

Let us see who this character is
```{r demo6, exercise=TRUE}
df |> dplyr::filter(mass > 1000)
```

**Jabba the Hutt!!** (picture below)

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ornjSExjtUXRXY784/giphy.gif)

***

Now let us remove Jabba and rerun the previous analyis

```{r demo7, exercise=TRUE}
df_adj <- df |>  dplyr::filter(mass <500) 

pearson_r <- cor.test(df_adj$height, # defines variable 1
                      df_adj$mass, # defines variable 2
                                   method="pearson", # defines which correlation type to calculate
                                   use="complete.obs") # specifies that missing data should not be considered

print(pearson_r)
```

The correlation coefficient is high now (r = .76) and the p-value is significant (p = 4.018e-12)!

***

Let us now plot the relationship again with our new data set 

```{r demo9, exercise=TRUE}
df_adj <- df |>  dplyr::filter(mass <500) 
ggplot(data = df_adj, aes(x = height, y = mass))+ #Ggplot
  geom_point()
```

This looks better! 
We can ask R to visualize the linear model between `height` and `mass`
```{r demo10, exercise=TRUE}
df_adj <- df |>  dplyr::filter(mass <500) 
ggplot(data = df_adj, aes(x = height, y = mass))+ #Ggplot
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x)
```

We can further improve the plot by e.g.: 

- adding a title
- renaming the axes
- highlighting the plot in relation to other variables, such as their `sex`
- increasing the size of dots
- changing colors and renaming the legend title

```{r demo11, exercise=TRUE}
df_adj <- df |>  dplyr::filter(mass <500) 
ggplot(df_adj |>  dplyr::filter(mass <500), aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = sex),size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x, colour = "grey")+
  labs(title = "Height and Mass of Star Wars Characters", 
       y = "Mass (kg)", x = "Height (m)")+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_color_manual("Sex", values = c("#626496", "#F5B355", "#C43142", "grey"))

```

That`s it! In the following chapters, you will learn how to repeat this workflow (any many things more)!

## 1. First Steps

You can execute R code in a few ways:

-   Put your cursor on the line that contains R code and press "Run" on
    the top right side of this panel
-   Put your cursor on the line that contains R code and press ctrl +
    enter (german keyboard: strg + enter)

Try the different ways to execute R code with the following three lines

```{r test1, exercise=TRUE}
1+1
```

```{r test2, exercise=TRUE}
2/10
```

```{r test3, exercise=TRUE}
"Hello world!"
```

***

**Now let us start with some math** `r emo::ji("thumbs up")`

Addition

```{r adding, exercise=TRUE}
10+10
```

Subtraction

```{r subtraction,exercise=TRUE}
15-12
```

Division

```{r division,exercise=TRUE}
31/14
```

Raise to the power of

```{r raise, exercise=TRUE}
10^1.5
```

**Congratulations!** You have started to execute your first lines of
code.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOxf7XfmpxuSode1O/giphy.gif).

Now, we will get to know **Data Types** and **Logical Operators**.

### Data Types

The data type of a variable can be shown with the `mode()` function.

For **numeric** data

```{r mode_numeric, exercise=TRUE}
mode(1)
```

For **character** data

```{r mode_character, exercise=TRUE}
mode("a")
```

For **logical** data

```{r mode_logical, exercise=TRUE}
mode(T)
```

Variables of type character and numeric can't be added

```{r mode_error, exercise=TRUE}
"2" + 2
```

Next, we will get to know R *logical operations*.

### Logical Operations

Some logical operations. Just try them out!

Equal - Logical Statements I

```{r logical_true, exercise=TRUE}
T == T
```

Equal - Logical Statements II


```{r logical_false, exercise=TRUE}
F == T
```

Equal - Numbers

```{r logical_numeric, exercise=TRUE}
1 == 1
```

Greater than

```{r logical_numeric2, exercise=TRUE}
10^21 < 15^23
```

Not equal to

```{r logical_numeric3, exercise=TRUE}
10 != 10 & 10 == 10 
```

As you can see, logical operators work with numbers as well
`r emo::ji("check")`

> `10 != 10 & 10 == 10` is the same as `F & T`

It should not suprise you that there are a lot of logical operators. The
most common being

-   `>` (larger than )
-   `<` (smaller than)
-   `==` (equal to)
-   `!=` (not equal to)
-   `>=` (greater or equal than)
-   `<=` (smaller or equal than)
-   `&` (and)
-   `|` (or)

**We are almost done**. 
But before we will train our progress, we to further get to know the building blocks of R code.

***

### Functions

> Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a
> specific task. Functions usually take in some sort of data structure,
> process it, and return a result

One (of many) function in R is the `sqrt()` function. Maybe you can find
out what it does by executing the next line?

```{r function_1, exercise=TRUE}
sqrt(10)
```

Another function in R is the `round()` function. This one might be
easier?

```{r function_2, exercise=TRUE}
round(2.2412)
```

Often, we do not know what functions exactly do. In this case, we can
access the documentation using the `?` in front of the function body or
search for the documentation online [see here for an
example](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/Round).

> Function documentation is used to describe the **purpose, input,
> output, and other details of a function**. Function documentation is
> important because it helps other programmers understand how to use a
> function correctly and effectively

### Exercises Lession 1

***

Great, now lets practice everything we have learned so far.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/TKNGghpLhaz9XH1tSj/giphy.gif).

#### Arithmetics

Execute the lines by putting the cursor on the line and press ctrl +
enter:

Check the result in the console down below.

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Calculate two plus five

```{r ex1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex1-solution}
2+5
```

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Calculate two divided by five

```{r ex2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex2-solution}
2/5
```

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Raise ten by the power of two

```{r ex3, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex3-solution}
10^2
```

Lets check out *operator precedence*. Operator precedence is a fancy
term for the fact that R follows the general rules of arithmetic. This
means, for example, that multiplication is executed before addition. You
can enforce a different order of execution by using round brackets `()`

To give an example, please compare the output of the two code chunks.
Are they identical?

```{r ex4,exercise=TRUE }
10+5*2
```

```{r ex5, exercise=TRUE}
(10+5)*2
```

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Calculate five times ten plus one without round brackets

```{r ex6, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex6-solution}
5*10+1
```

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Now calculate five times ten plus one but use round brackets
to first execute ten plus one

```{r ex7, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex7-solution}
5*(10+1)
```

#### Logical Operations

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Check whether `10^23` is larger than `5^46`.

```{r log1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r log1-solution}
10^23 > 5^46
```

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Is `10^(1/2)` equal to `sqrt(10)`?

```{r log2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r log2-solution}
10^(1/2) == sqrt(10)
```

You can check whether two statements both evaluate to true with `&`.

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Check whether both `10` is larger than `5` and `5` is larger than `19` using the & operator

```{r log4, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r log4-solution}
10 > 5 & 5 >19
```


<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Repeat the same statement but change the `&` operator to the `|` (or) operator. 
Why do we get a different result?

```{r log3, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r log3-solution}
10 > 5 | 5 >19
```

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Please test whether 3 is equal to 4

```{r ex8, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex8-solution}
3 == 4
```

Did it throw an error?

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Please test whether either 3 or 4 is equal to 4

```{r ex9, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex9-solution}
3 | 4 == 4
```

#### Functions

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Calculate the square root of 36 by using sqrt()

```{r ex10, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex10-solution}
sqrt(36)
```

***

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Round `2.12428989` to the nearest integer using `round()`

```{r ex11, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex11-solution}
round(2.1242)
```

<span class="warning">**Task**</span>: Now try to use the `round()` function for the integer `2.12428989`, but round to the **second decimal point**.

Note: Please try to find out for yourself how to set the number of decimal points
for rounding.

If you can not find answers using the documentation, you can always search for tutorials and explanations on sites such as [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43444752/how-to-round-up-to-whole-number-in-r). This is the typical programming workflow and you should get familiar with it as soon as possible to make the most out of your learning experience!

```{r ex12, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex12-solution}
?round
round(2.12428989,digits = 2)
```

**Great, you are doing a very good job**

## 2. Variables and Vectors

### Variables

Now we move to using variables. Variables enable you to store values and
reuse them later. Variable assignment in R is done using the assignment
operator `<-`.

```{r v1_1, exercise =TRUE}
some_variable <- 15  
```

By executing the code, you have just created a new variable in the local R
environment

> "The R environment can be thought of as a *collection of objects*
> (functions, variables etc.). Any objects created are automatically
> saved and can be reused later"

**Important**: In this tutorial, each code chunk holds its own R environment.
As you will see later, RStudio is able to store - and reuse - all variables globally.

Please execute the following code. What happens here?

```{r v2, exercise =TRUE}
some_variable <- 15  
print(some_variable)
```

The object `some_variable` now contains the value assigned `15`.
Now, we can even do math with the variable

```{r v3, exercise =TRUE}
some_variable <- 15 
some_variable+10
```

`25`! Great, this does not throw an error! `r emo::ji("thumbs up")`

***

### Vectors 

A vector contains multiple elements of the same type (integer, double, character, logical,...).You can create a vector by using the combine function `c()`. 
An example:

```{r v20, exercise = TRUE}
a_vector <- c(1,2,3,4) 
print(a_vector)
```

If you want to create a character vector, all you need to make sure is to use elements of the same data type

```{r v21, exercise = TRUE}
char_vec <- c("This is", "a","character vector", "with 4 elements.")
print(char_vec)
```

Same goes with logicals

```{r v222, exercise = TRUE}
log_vec <- c(T,T,F,F)
print(log_vec)
```

***

You can access the elements of an vector with the square brackets `[]`
```{r v22, exercise = TRUE}
char_vec <- c("This is", "a","character vector", "with 4 elements.")
char_vec[3] # Getting the third element of char_vec
```

You can access several elements of an vector with the square brackets `[]`

```{r v223, exercise = TRUE}
char_vec <- c("This is", "a","character vector", "with 4 elements.")
char_vec[1:3] # Getting the first to the third element of char_vec
```

What happens here?

```{r v224, exercise = TRUE}
char_vec <- c("This is", "a","character vector", "with 4 elements.")
char_vec[-3] # ?
```

***

We can also use functions to create new vector!

```{r v23, exercise = TRUE}
a_vector <- c(1,2,3,4)
print(a_vector)
```

```{r v25, exercise = TRUE}
a_vector <- c(1,2,3,4)
b_vector <- rep(x = a_vector, times = 2) # creates a new vector which repeats "a_vector" two times.
print(b_vector)
```

If you know the position of the arguments, you can omit naming the arguments.

```{r v26, exercise = TRUE}
a_vector <- c(1,2,3,4)
b_vector <- rep(a_vector, 2) # creates a new vector which repeats "a_vector" two times.
print(b_vector)
```

Lastly, we can also create completely new vectors

```{r v27, exercise = TRUE}
seq(1,10,0.01) # Creates a numerical vector with 100 elements. Can you think of what this function does (before running the code) 
```

### Exercises Lession 2

***

Great, now lets practice everything we have learned so far.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/TKNGghpLhaz9XH1tSj/giphy.gif).

#### Vectors and vector operations

<span class="warning">Task</span>: Now let us calculate the mean of the numbers `3,4,5,3,5`. 
We can make the calculation easier to read by splitting the calculation into two
parts:

1. First, save the results of the summation in a variable called
   `result_sum`
2. Second, divide the variable `result_sum` by five and save the
   results in the new variable `result_mean`.
3. Print the `result_mean` vector using the `print()` function

```{r f1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r f1-solution}
result_sum <- 3+4+5+3+5
result_mean <- result_sum/5
print(result_mean)
```

<span class="warning">Task</span>: Create your own vector with character values and save it in a variable called "character_variable"-
To signify that a value is a character you need to quote it (`"text"`).

Then print the vector out by using `print(character_variable)`

```{r vo1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r vo1-solution}
character_variable <- c("R","is a great","Language") #This is just an example
print(character_variable)
```

***
<span class="warning">Task</span>: Create a vector `log_vec`with logicals (`T` or `F`). Then print the vector out by using `print(log_vec)`


```{r vo2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r vo2-solution}
log_vec <- c(T,F,T,T) #This is just an example
print(log_vec)
```
***
<span class="warning">Task</span>: Use the colon `:` operator to create a numerical vector with 10 elements ranging from 1 to 10. You don`t have to save this vector.

```{r vo3, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r vo3-solution}
1:10
```
***
<span class="warning">Task</span>: Try to create the same vector as above but in reversed order using the colon ":" operator. 

```{r vo4, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r vo4-solution}
10:1
```
***
<span class="warning">Task</span>: Use the `seq()` function to create a sequence from 0 to 1 in 0.1 increments.
 If you want to know the arguments to the `seq()` function type `help(seq)`.
 
```{r vo5, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r vo5-solution}
seq(0,1,0.1)
```
***
<span class="warning">Task</span>: Use the `rep()` function to create a character vector with 5 repetitions of `"a"`.
If you want to know the arguments to the `rep()` function type `help(rep)`.

```{r vo6, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r vo6-solution}
rep("a",5)
```

***
<span class="warning">Task</span>: Use the `rep()` function to create a character vector `character_variable_doubled` with 5 repetitions of the  variable `character variable` which is created in the first line.
Then print the vector out by using `print(character_variable_doubled)`

```{r vo7, exercise=TRUE}
character_variable <- c("a","b","c")
# Here comes your code

#Last step
print(character_variable_doubled)

```

```{r vo7-solution}
character_variable <- c("a","b","c")
character_variable_doubled <- rep(character_variable,5)
print(character_variable_doubled)
```


#### Accessing elements of a vector 

Let`s keep in mind: 
- You can access elements of a vector using square brackets `[]`. 
- `vec[1]`extracts the first element of a vector
- `vec[c(1,2)] ` uses a second vector for multiple indices. Extracts first and second element


<span class="warning">Task</span>: Execute the following code. Please try to find out what the ``rnorm() function does`.

```{r vo8, exercise=TRUE}
a_random_vec <- rnorm(1000) #draws 1000 random numbers from the standard normal distribution
```

<span class="warning">Task</span>: Access the 500th element of `a_random_vec`

```{r vo9, exercise=TRUE}
a_random_vec <- rnorm(1000) 
# Here comes your code

```

```{r vo9-solution}
a_random_vec <- rnorm(1000) 
a_random_vec[500]
```

## 3. Vectorized functions

Vectors are great! They are the building blocks of every data analysis tasks you will encounter. Keep in mind that a vector contains only one type of data (either numeric, character or logical).  

***

### Vectorized Math

Like in the last session, we will first create a numerical vector `vec_1`

```{r vf1, exercise=TRUE}
vec_1 <- c(100,500,200)
vec_1
```

We can now start to work with this vector!

***
Division

```{r vf2, exercise=TRUE}
vec_1 <- c(100,500,200)
vec_1/100
```

Lets create a second vector `vec_2`. What happes here?

```{r vf3, exercise=TRUE}
vec_1 <- c(100,500,200)
vec_2 <- c(10,50,20)

vec_1 + vec_2 
```

Multiplication

```{r vf4, exercise=TRUE}
vec_1 <- c(100,500,200); vec_2 <- c(10,50,20) #This creates both vector in the same line

vec_1 * vec_2 
```

Division

```{r vf5, exercise=TRUE}
vec_1 <- c(100,500,200); vec_2 <- c(10,50,20) #This creates both vector in the same line
vec_1 / vec_2 
```

### Vectorized Functions

Functions are great for working with vectors. 

In R there are many functions which take a vector and create a new vector (e.g., `scale()`, `ifelse()`)

```{r vf99, exercise=TRUE}
a_vector <- 1:100
scale(a_vector)
```

```{r vf6, exercise=TRUE}
a_vector <- 1:100
ifelse(test = a_vector > 20, yes = 1, no = 0)
```

But there are also many functions which reduce a vector to a single value (e.g., `mean()`, `sd()`, `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`,
`length()`)

Please try to find out what the following functions do! 

`mean()`

```{r vf7, exercise=TRUE}
a_vector <- 1:100
mean(a_vector)
```

`sd()`

```{r vf11, exercise=TRUE}
a_vector <- 1:100
sd(a_vector)
```

`sum()`

```{r vf21, exercise=TRUE}
a_vector <- 1:100
sum(a_vector)
```

`min()`

```{r vf31, exercise=TRUE}
a_vector <- 1:100
min(a_vector)
```

`max()`

```{r vf41, exercise=TRUE}
a_vector <- 1:100
max(a_vector)
```

`length()`

```{r vf47, exercise=TRUE}
a_vector <- 1:100
length(a_vector)
```

### Exercises Lession 3

***

Great, now lets practice everything we have learned so far.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xThtalqfyXJRReaH2E/giphy.gif).

***

#### Vector operations - numeric I

In this exercise, we will also build on previous lessons! If you are unsure, just have a look at the scripts again.

<span class="warning">Task</span>: Try the following operators with `vec_1` and `vec_2`:  `+`, `-`, `*`, `^`.
Check the results in the console to see what the resulting vector looks like.

```{r vf51, exercise=TRUE}
vec_1 <- c(1,2,3,4); vec_2 <- c(4,3,2,1)
#Here comes your code


```

```{r vf51-solution}
vec_1 <- c(1,2,3,4); vec_2 <- c(4,3,2,1)

vec_1 + vec_2
vec_1 - vec_2
vec_1 * vec_2
vec_1 ^ vec_2

```

***

Lets try to replicate the example from the slides.
We have a vector with numbers from 1 to 100 and we want to create a vector which shows us whether a number is smaller or larger than 50.


<span class="warning">Task</span>: Adjust the code below that it works

```{r vf61, exercise=TRUE}
num_vec <- 1:100
 
ifelse(test = num_vec  > 50,) # The test is already in place, complete the function
                              # by adding the case for when the test is true (1) and when its false (0).
                              # If you don`t remember the arguments of ifelse, type help(ifelse)
```

```{r vf61-solution}
num_vec <- 1:100
 
ifelse(test = num_vec  > 50,yes = 1, no = 0)
```

***

Now lets work on a more practical example. We have a vector of birth years from 1950 to 2000

`birth_year_vec <- sample(x = 1950:2000,size = 10000,replace = T) #the sample function creates a vector of random draws from 1950 to 2000`

You can check whether one ore multiple values are in a vector by using the `%in%` operator.

A quick example: 

```{r vf89, exercise=TRUE}
a_vec <- c(1,2,3,4)
3 %in% a_vec
```

```{r vf899, exercise=TRUE}
a_vec <- c(1,2,3,4)
c(3,5) %in% a_vec # Shows whether 3 and 5 are in "a_vec" 
```

<span class="warning">Task</span>: Check whether the year 1987 is in `birth_year_vec`

```{r vf62, exercise=TRUE}
birth_year_vec <- sample(x = 1950:2000,size = 10000,replace = T) #the sample function creates a vector of random draws from 1950 to 2000
#Here comes your code

```


```{r vf62-solution}
birth_year_vec <- sample(x = 1950:2000,size = 10000,replace = T) 
1987 %in% birth_year_vec
```


<span class="warning">Task</span>: Write an `ifelse()` test that checks which elements of `birth_year_vec` are larger than 1980, but smaller than 1990.

```{r vf63, exercise=TRUE}
birth_year_vec <- sample(x = 1950:2000,size = 10000,replace = T) 
#Here comes your code

```

```{r vf63-solution}
birth_year_vec <- sample(x = 1950:2000,size = 10000,replace = T) 
ifelse(birth_year_vec > 1980 & birth_year_vec < 1990,1,0)

```

#### Vector operations - numeric II

Reducing vectors to a single number is a common task in statistics. Mean, variance or correlations are all are examples of this. Because R is a programming language for statistics, many common statistics are implemented directly as functions. 

<span class="warning">Task</span>: Please create a numeric vector `num_vec` and calculate at least three summary statistics (e.g., `mean()`, `var()`, `sd()`, etc.)

```{r vf66, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r vf66-solution}
#Example
num_vec <- c(50,100,24,25,342,754,324,123)

mean(num_vec)
var(num_vec)
sd(num_vec)

```

Often times we encounter missing values in our data. In R missing data is signified as `NA`.


```{r vf67}
num_vec <- c(50,100,24,25,342,754,324,123,NA)
```

<span class="warning">Task</span>: Try the `mean()` function again with `num_vec.` 
Spoiler: It won't work without some light modification.

Check the help page of mean with `help(mean)` and try to solve the problem. 

```{r vf661, exercise=TRUE}
num_vec <- c(50,100,24,25,342,754,324,123,NA)

```

```{r vf661-solution}
num_vec <- c(50,100,24,25,342,754,324,123,NA)
mean(num_vec,na.rm = T)
```

Finally, we often want to calculate the correlation between two variables.
A very basic way to do this in R is the `cor()` function. Try it with `num_vec` and `num_vec_2`.

```{r vf662, exercise=TRUE}
num_vec <- c(50,100,24,25,342,754,324,123)
num_vec_2 <- c(235,121,46,765,23,321,124,975)
#Here comes your code

```

```{r vf662-solution}
num_vec <- c(50,100,24,25,342,754,324,123)
num_vec_2 <- c(235,121,46,765,23,321,124,975)
cor(num_vec,num_vec_2)
```

There is also a t-test function. Use Google to find the right function in R and use it with `num_vec` and `num_vec_2`.

```{r vf664, exercise=TRUE}
num_vec <- c(50,100,24,25,342,754,324,123)
num_vec_2 <- c(235,121,46,765,23,321,124,975)
#Here comes your code

```

```{r vf664-solution}
num_vec <- c(50,100,24,25,342,754,324,123)
num_vec_2 <- c(235,121,46,765,23,321,124,975)
t.test(num_vec,num_vec_2)
```

#### Vector operations - character

`paste()` is a function that works with text data. It can be used to merge two or more separate text variables into one

Please execute the following code

```{r vf64, exercise=TRUE}
some_text <- "This is a"
some_other_text <- "complete sentence."
paste(some_text,some_other_text)
```

`paste()` is also vectorized. This means that text vectors of equal length will be merged element wise.

```{r vf643, exercise=TRUE}
first_names <- c("Luke","Darth","Han")
last_names <- c("Skywalker","Vader","Solo")

# Use paste with "first_names" and "last_names"
paste(first_names,last_names)
```

<span class="warning">Task</span>: Please use the same command but add "is a fictional character" (with the quotation marks) as a third element to the `paste()` function?

```{r vf65, exercise=TRUE}
first_names <- c("Luke","Darth","Han"); last_names <- c("Skywalker","Vader","Solo") #this loads the character variables
#Here comes your code

```

```{r vf65-solution}
first_names <- c("Luke","Darth","Han"); last_names <- c("Skywalker","Vader","Solo") #this loads the character variables
paste(first_names,last_names,"is a fictional character")

```

<span class="warning">Task</span>: Check out the `paste()` help page and find how to add a comma separating the terms

```{r vf668, exercise=TRUE}
first_names <- c("Luke","Darth","Han"); last_names <- c("Skywalker","Vader","Solo") #this loads the character variables
#Here comes your code
```

```{r vf668-solution}
first_names <- c("Luke","Darth","Han"); last_names <- c("Skywalker","Vader","Solo") #this loads the character variables
paste(first_names,last_names,"is a fictional character",sep = ",")
```

## 4. Writing your own functions

### Writing your own function

R gives you the ability to create your own functions. Functions are at the essence of working with R. 
They allow to repeat a certain amount of code multiple times. 

There are several elements to a function. The picture below outlines these elements on the function `introduction()``

<img src="./images/function.jpg" width="775" dpi="420"/>

1. **Function name**: You can name a function using the `<- operator`. In our case, the function is called "introduction"
2. **Function arguments**: You can specify which input a function takes ("arguments"). In our case, there is one argument called "name" 
3. **Function body**: The function body contains the code of the function. The code within a function body uses the input provided by the arguments and executes the code within the function body. In our case, the function body creates a new variable `greeting` using the `paste()` function from the character string "Hello, its" and the character string provided by the argument "name". 
It is good practice to define what each function should return. In our case, we want to return the final introduction sentence which is saved in the variable `greeting`. 


****

Lets create the function here and try it out. 

Creating the new function `introduction()` and calling the argument "Luke Skywalker"

```{r fd1, exercise=TRUE}
introduction <- function(name){
	# Function Body
	greeting <- paste("Hello, it`s",name)
	return(greeting)}

introduction("Luke Skywalker")

```

Worked! Do you understand what happened?

***

What happens if we give it a numeric value? 

```{r fd2, exercise=TRUE}
introduction <- function(name){
	# Function Body
	greeting <- paste("Hello, it`s",name)
	return(greeting)}

introduction(1)

```

It takes the numeric input `1` and adds it to the sentence. Great!

***

We can also provide it with a sequence of character strings. What do you think our function does now? 

```{r fd3, exercise=TRUE}
introduction <- function(name){
	# Function Body
	greeting <- paste("Hello, it`s",name)
	return(greeting)}

characters <- c("Luke Skywalker", "Darth Vader")

introduction(characters)

```

### Exercises Lession 4

#### add_two_numbers()

<span class="warning">Task</span>: Complete the function `add_two_numbers()` which should add two numbers

```{r fd4, exercise=TRUE}

add_two_numbers <-function(a,b){
  result <- ???
  return(results)}

add_two_numbers(15,30)

```

```{r fd4-solution}
add_two_numbers <- function(a,b){ # add two function arguments
  result <- a+b # Write the addition of the function arguments
    return(result)
}

add_two_numbers(15,30)

```

***

#### invert_num_vec()

Now we will Write a function to solve a (slightly) more common problem. 
A numerical vector can be inverted by subtracting it from its maximum + 1

Try it out below

```{r fd59, exercise=TRUE}
num_vec <- c(1,2,3,4)
num_vec_inv <- (max(num_vec)+1)-num_vec
num_vec_inv
```
Now, the vector is inverted!

***

We can use a function to automate this process for future applications. You can use the `max()` function to get the maximum of any vector.

<span class="warning">Task</span>: Create the function `invert_num_vec()` and invert the values of `num_vec`.

```{r fd5, exercise=TRUE}
num_vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,10) #This just loads the vector

invert_num_vec <- ???
  
invert_num_vec(num_vec)

```

```{r fd5-solution}
num_vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,10) #This just loads the vector

invert_num_vec <- function(vector_to_invert){ # The argument to the function should be a vector. 
  max_of_vec <- max(vector_to_invert)
  inverted_vector <- (max_of_vec+1)-vector_to_invert
  # This variable should contain the results
  return(inverted_vector)
}
  
invert_num_vec(num_vec)

```

***

Great! Now we make it a little bit more challenging. 
Please rerun the following line of code
```{r fd6, exercise=TRUE}
num_vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5,NA,6,10) #This just loads the vector

invert_num_vec <- function(vector_to_invert){ # The argument to the function should be a vector. 
  max_of_vec <- max(vector_to_invert)
  inverted_vector <- (max_of_vec+1)-vector_to_invert
  # This variable should contain the results
  return(inverted_vector)
}
  
invert_num_vec(num_vec)
```

What is the difference? Yes, the NA!

***

<span class="warning">Task</span>: Please adjust the code of the function we have created to ignore the NA´s. 

(Hint: Maybe you want to have a look at the documentation of the `max()` function)

```{r fd7, exercise=TRUE}
num_vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5,NA, 6,10) #This just loads the vector

invert_num_vec <- function(vector_to_invert){ # The argument to the function should be a vector. 
  max_of_vec <- max(vector_to_invert)
  inverted_vector <- (max_of_vec+1)-vector_to_invert
  # This variable should contain the results
  return(inverted_vector)
}
  
invert_num_vec(num_vec)

```

```{r fd7-solution}

num_vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5,NA, 6,10) #This just loads the vector

invert_num_vec <- function(vector_to_invert){ # The argument to the function should be a vector. 
  max_of_vec <- max(vector_to_invert,na.rm=T)
  inverted_vector <- (max_of_vec+1)-vector_to_invert
  # This variable should contain the results
  return(inverted_vector)
}

invert_num_vec(num_vec)

```

## 5. Iterations

Iteration describes the possibility to repeatedly execute code. In R this is often done with vectorization.
However sometimes you need more powerful tools to execute code repeatedly. 
- `for`-loop
- `Map()` functions from the “purrr” package (from the tidyverse)

***

There are three parts to a loop. The picture below outlines these parts`

<img src="./images/loop.jpg" width="475" dpi="320"/>

1. **Output** - A variable which stores the results of the for loop
2. **The Sequence** - to loop over. In this case we have 10 numbers. Each of the numbers is given a position from 1 to 10. 
3. **Body** - Just like with functions the code of the for loop is surrounded by curly brackets. The code in the brackets is executed once with each value of i.

***

How does the iterator in the for-loop work?

```{r i11, exercise=TRUE}
for(i in 1:10){
  print(paste("The iterator i is",i))
}
```


You can create an iterator that is the same length as a vector with `seq_along()`

```{r i12, exercise=TRUE}
a_vector <- 40:42

for(i in seq_along(a_vector)){
  print(paste("The iterator i is",i))
}
```

***

Iteration is mostly used to apply a function to a number of elements

```{r i13, exercise=TRUE}
add_one <- function(a_number){
  return(a_number + 1)
}

a_vector <- c(23,10,9)

result_for_loop <- c() # A result vector

for(i in seq_along(a_vector)){
  result_for_loop[i] <- add_one(a_vector[i])
  # Below is a print command to show what is going on
  print(paste("At position",i,"one is added to",a_vector[i]))
}

result_for_loop
```

## 6. Outlook

Great, you successfully spend your first day learning and working with R. 

Now we are fully equipped to start hands on data analysis. In R, this usually means working with dataframes. 
For now, the dataframe `df` is already loaded. We have gotten to know the dataframe already in the Teaser Section.

Nedless to say, a dataframe looks like this

```{r o1}
print(df)
```

Of course, we can also browse trough the dataframe. 
To do so, just execute the code below

```{r o2, exercise=TRUE}
print(df)

```

In the second part of the course, you will get to know the most relevant tools to work with dataframes. 

However, to really unleash the potential of R, we usually have R locally installed on our device and execute code in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called RStudio. 

<img src="./images/rstudio.png" width="355"/>

- You can install R from the “cran” website, where you have options for Mac, Windows, and Linux. https://cran.r-project.org/ 
- You can install RStudio (please do after installing R) from the RStudio website, where you have options for Mac, Windows, and Linux. https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download 

If you run into problems during the installation of R and/or RStudio, we suggest you first have a look at one of the following YouTube videos detailing the installation process for different operating systems:

- Mac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LanBozXJjOk
- Linux (Ubuntu): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24TtO1fR6SI
- Windows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2sewGCA0y4

If that does not work for you, please contact Matthias or Lukas (matthias.roth@gesis.org & Lukas.Birkenmaier@gesis.org) and we will try to solve the problem together.
